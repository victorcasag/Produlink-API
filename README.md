#The Produlink API Project is a RESTful API developed to be used within the context of the main "Produlink" project. 

The API is responsible for providing a robust server for inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting data related to products, customers, and suppliers in a database. 
This API is designed to run in a Docker container and integrates with the PostgreSQL database management system.

Key Features:

Product management: The API allows adding, updating, and deleting information about products, including details such as name, description, price, stock quantity, and other relevant information.
Customer management: It is possible to register customers, update their data, search for contact information, address, and other associated customer details.
Supplier management: The API enables the registration of suppliers, including details such as company name, contact information, and other related data.

Technologies used:

RESTful API: The RESTful architecture is adopted to provide a uniform and scalable communication interface between the client and the server.
Docker container: The project is configured to run in a containerized environment, facilitating deployment and scalability.
PostgreSQL database: The PostgreSQL database management system is used to store and retrieve data related to products, customers, and suppliers.
This project is ideal for developers interested in building a robust RESTful API for integration with product, customer, and supplier management systems. Additionally, it provides a great opportunity to learn about technologies such as Docker, PostgreSQL, and scalable API development practices.
